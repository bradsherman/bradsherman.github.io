title: About me

Hello! My name is Brad and I'm a software engineer currently living in Chicago, IL. I graduated from the University of Notre Dame in May 2018 with a bachelor's of computer science.

I have recently become enthralled with functional programming languages and open source software, so I'll likely be writing about those topics quite a bit. I'm also an infovore and am interested in learning how to efficiently process all the information that I come across everyday in the form of books, articles, videos, and whatever else I can get my hands on.
