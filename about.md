title: About Me
---

Hello! My name is Brad and I'm a software engineer currently living in Chicago, IL. I graduated from the University of Notre Dame in May 2018 with a bachelor's of computer science.

I have recently become enthralled with functional programming languages and open source software, so I'll likely be writing about those topics quite a bit. I'm also an [infovore](https://www.yourdictionary.com/infovore) and am interested in learning how to efficiently process all the information that I come across everyday in the form of books, articles, videos, and whatever else I can get my hands on.

Outside of technology I love to read, travel, ski, and watch/play sports. My claim to fame is that I was a member of the [student practice team](https://ndsmcobserver.com/2018/04/student-practice-squad-helps-womens-basketball-prepare-for-games/) that practiced with the 2018 National Champion University of Notre Dame Women's basketball team!
