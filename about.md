subtitle: Why I decided to create this blog
---

Hello! My name is Brad and I'm a software engineer currently living in Chicago, IL.
I graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 2018 with a computer science degree.
I enjoy reading and learning about various topics within the tech space such as
open source software, programming languages, data engineering, and many other things.

I started this blog because I've found that too many times I will spend time learning
about something in a shallow way and not really retain anything from the experience.
By writing about what I read and learn I hope to force myself to truly understand
the underlying concepts before moving on to my next adventure.
